Sixth World
=================
A Shadowrun hack for Dungeon World


Originally created by Chris Clouser and Tanner Yea, Sixth World is an adaption of the Shadowrun setting to 
Dungeon World/Apocalypse World rules. 

However, the original version of Sixth World was created using Adobe products and was difficult to distribute in an easily editable form.

The aim of this project is to port the Sixth World document into LaTeX, allowing everyone to make their own changes and still have a nicely formatted document in the end.


Requirements
------------

Sixth World requires several decorative fonts, so this version is designed to be built with the XeTeX Tex engine.

You can get XeTeX here: http://xetex.sourceforge.net/

The required fonts are listed below:

 - Shadowrun - http://rpg.divnull.com/srun/fonts.html

 - Fate Core Glyphs - http://www.faterpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Fate-Core-Font.ttf_.zip

 - Orbitron - https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Orbitron

 - Oswald - https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald

These need to be available to XeTeX, which usually means they should be installed on your system. However, installing fonts and XeTeX is beyond the scope of this Readme. Please consult your OS documentation and XeTeX's documentation.
